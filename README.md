# Restaurant Client Server application for Android

**NOTE: This experimental and unmaintained.**

A Client server application for Restaurant Management.
It was built entirely in Tcl (client + Server)
I've given up on it since the Tcl client with Androwish took too much time to build.
A HTMl client alternative would be the best.

It allowed registration of users.
They could view a menu
Order what they wanted. The order would go be approved by a waiter and it would go to the Cook. users could view each step of the process and what is ready.
+ other marketing tricks
